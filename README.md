Above Creates
● An EC2 instance of type t2.micro based on any linux distro. 
● A Load Balancer forwarding incoming requests to the EC2 instance. 
 
The EC2 instance needs to run an Nginx web server serving one HTML file (just make one                 up and make the file part of your Github repo). Please create a README.md file inside your                 repository documenting your project.
